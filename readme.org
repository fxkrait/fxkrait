<li><b><i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6881157-the-way-of-life">Sane</a> 🪷:</i> A sane man, is sane, in knowing what he can spare. In not wishing, what most people wish. In not grasping, what seems rare. The cultured, may call him heathenish, this man of few words. His one care, is not to interfere, but to let nature renew, upon that sense of direction, which most men undo.</b></li>

The undefiled, extend care to the disordered, and dance amongst the misfit. Unafraid of vanquishment in any dark, they illuminate as a different kind of light - not sure. No crosses to bear, no tautologies, OK just here.</li>
<li><b><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuWsua1_gQ0inbBTqxmYuIQ">Self-Absenting Love</a> 🪞:</i></b> We cannot love others or love 'god', while cursing ourselves. We cannot offer unto others, that which we, do not have. To be uncritical towards others, we first must not be critical towards ourselves. There is the land of the ego, where we get high off emotions, and their causal thoughts. We are devoid of spirit, rooted in the material and the flesh, entrenched in death, dying, decay, and are ignorant to anything outside of our self-constructed selves and opinions. There is also the land of the spirit, where we rest in attention, in a self-absenting love, and let down our ties and bindings to the past.</li>

Genuine human interaction, is voluntary, sovereign, and limited. Man-made laws are arbitrary and limitless commands of compliance, backed by the threat, or use of violence. Government, is coercive, violent, unbounded, and conducted primarily to bring human behavior into compliance with the will of a dominating, and occulted ruling class. Government, is simply a euphemism for slavery. Though a free society is a moral society, a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libre">libre</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon">archon</a>-y (free of archons, promote and cultivate libre systems, transparency) is preferred over any consolidated usurpations, as that which has yet to enforce any tower-of-babel control structures, retains the space, sovereignty, and spirit, to nurture and propagate liberty. 🕊️🪺 Endemic coercion + inscrutable systems = it's hard to be.</li>

Exhaust and exhume thyself. Greek tragedy. No transcendental realms. No escape or relief hatches. Emeritus of reality 💐.
